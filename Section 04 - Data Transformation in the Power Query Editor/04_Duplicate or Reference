Duplicate or Reference
======================

Reference
=========

  + In Reference there is a Ddirect Connection.
  + If we take a Reference of our Table or Query.
  + We will get a Query with Exact Same Data from the Previous Query.
  + And if we make a Change in the Query 1.
  + It will Reflect in the Query 2 as well with any changes made in the Query 2.

Duplicate
=========

  + In Duplicates, there is no Direct Connection.
  + If we take Duplicate of our Table.
  + Then we will get the same copy of the Query.
  + If we make any Change in the Query 1.
  + Then It will not reflect in the Duplicate Query.
  + So we will be able to Change the Seperate Dataset.
