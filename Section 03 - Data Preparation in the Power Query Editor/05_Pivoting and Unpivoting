Pivoting and Unpivoting
=======================

What does pivoting a table do?
==============================
A pivot table is a statistics tool that summarizes and reorganizes selected 
columns and rows of data in a spreadsheet or database table to obtain a desired report. 
The tool does not actually change the spreadsheet or database itself, 
it simply “pivots” or turns the data to view it from different perspectives.


What does it mean to Unpivot a table?
=====================================
In Excel, unpivot data means to transform your data from columns to rows, 
where column headings are one row and the rows of data below the columns become their own separate, 
combined row.
