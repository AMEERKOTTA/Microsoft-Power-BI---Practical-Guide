Pivoting and Unpivoting
=======================

What does pivoting a table do?
==============================
A pivot table is a statistics tool that summarizes and reorganizes selected 
columns and rows of data in a spreadsheet or database table to obtain a desired report. 
The tool does not actually change the spreadsheet or database itself, 
it simply “pivots” or turns the data to view it from different perspectives.
