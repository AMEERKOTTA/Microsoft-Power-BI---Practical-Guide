Appending the Different Queries
===============================


Appending means Combining two or more tables to a single table.
We can append the table by using different methods.
By adding to exsting query
or by making different queries to another stand out query.


After we append the tables, it is not a good idea to make changes in previous individual queries.
Because they will reflect in the final appended query which is combined.
